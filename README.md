- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeaNehme
- 🔭 I’m a 2nd year PhD Candidate in Epidemiology.
- 👩🏼‍💻 My current work focuses on alcohol and substance use, socialcultural factors associated with alcohol use, substance abuse and mental health. 
- 🌱 The more I learn the more I realize I know nothing, so I am always trying to learn more. Specifically learning more about data science, substances          and mental health in emerging adults.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to alcohol and substance misuse/abuse
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I am Lebanese and trilingual.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at lnehm001@fiu.edu!
